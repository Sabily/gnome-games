.SH USAGE
This text is taken verbatim from the AisleRiot Manual V2.12.

Moving the cards is reasonably obvious. Assuming you have a right-handed mouse,
left-click on a card and drag it somewhere. Release the mouse button to deposit
the card.
 
If a card can be moved to the foundation(s), you do not need to drag it. You
can double-click on it and it will move. If a sequence of cards can be moved to
the foundations, you can generally move the sequence as one move.

Double clicking a card will send it to a foundation, if that is possible. This
is useful for cleaning up large numbers of cards at the end of a successful
game.

In games which have a stock pile you can redeal it by clicking on the empty
space where it was. Be warned that some games only let you do this a limited
number of time. Watch for the Redeals Left message at the bottom of the
window.
 
A useful tip to know is that right-clicking on a face-up card which is
partially obscured by a card laid over it will raise it so that you can see
what it is.
 
There is an alternative way to move cards. By selecting
.B Click to move
from the 
.B Control
menu you can click once to pick up a card and then click again to place it.
This can be faster than dragging and will be easier on your hand since you
don't have to hold the mouse down. However, it may take a while to get used to.
 
Some games have options to change the way the game is played. For example
Klondike can be played with either single card deals or three-card deals. In
these games there is a separate menu with the game's name. You can only change
the rules of the game at the beginning of the game -- the menu will be
inactive during the game.

Statistics on how well you have done at a particular game are available by
selecting
.B Statistics
from the Game menu. Only games where you actually start moving cards are
counted. The statistics are here for your own enjoyment, there are numerous
ways to cheat and it is unwise to make comparisons.
