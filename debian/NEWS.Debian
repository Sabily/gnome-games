gnome-games (1:2.8.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  A lot of the themes have been split into a separate package called
  gnome-games-extra-data. The core package now contains only a minimum
  amount of graphics, it is still functional, but your favourite themes
  may not be there. You can get the missing themes back by installing the
  gnome-games-extra-data package
